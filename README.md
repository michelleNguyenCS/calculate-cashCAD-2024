**Program Description:**\
Generates a cash amount, and users must determine the minimum number of bills and coins to make the amount.\
I made this program after working at my part-time job, and wanted to improve my speed in calculating change.

**Future Ideas:**
- Turn this into a cashier simulator.
- Users have to take customer orders, accept cash, and return change based on the types of bills and coins available in the register.
